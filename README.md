# Svelte Template App

This is a template app created with Svelte and a few Svelte libraries. It uses vanilla Svelte CSS styles

It is a simple site containing a number of **tabbed sections**

You may find it a reasonable starting point for something similar

There are many areas that can be improved :)

- HTML/CSS is possibly a but rough - I've used TailwindCSS elsewhere
- Modal popups are missing - see *Todos*
- Much much more ...

Enjoy!

# Svelte Template App

This is a template app created with Svelte and a few Svelte libraries. It uses vanilla Svelte CSS styles

It is a simple site containing a number of **tabbed sections**

You may find it a reasonable starting point for something similar

There are many areas that can be improved :)

- HTML/CSS is possibly a but rough - I've used TailwindCSS elsewhere
- Modal popups are missing - see *Todos*
- Much much more ...

Enjoy!

## Getting Started

You will need the usual Svelte prerequisite - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then you can do the usual npm stuff or use the *Makefile*

- make setup  => npm install
- make update => npm update
- make dev    => npm run dev
- make surge  => deploy to [surge](https://surge.sh/) (you need to create an account and set the URL)
